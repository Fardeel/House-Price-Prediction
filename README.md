#  House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle.  
It covers:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, RÂ²)
